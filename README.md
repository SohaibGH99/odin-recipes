# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipe website I’m building as part of The Odin Project. The goal is to practice the basics of HTML by creating a main page with links to individual recipes. Each recipe will include a title, an image, ingredients, and instructions.

Through this project, I’ll improve my skills in:

Structuring webpages with clean HTML.
Organizing files and using Git for version control.

This project is a fun way to solidify the fundamentals of web development!
